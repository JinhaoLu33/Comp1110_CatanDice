## Code Review

- Reviewed by: Samuel Mason-Cox
- Reviewing code written by: Hamish Hunter
- Component: canDoAction() Method

# Comments

- The canDoAction Method makes great use of the class infrastructure within the project, using several class-based 
  in-built methods rather than manipulating everything from string encodings.
- All variable names are great, and the comments provide clarity to the intended functionality and methodology of the program.
- The code style has some flaws, such as empty if and else statements, or unnecessary return and break statements.
- Some if statements can be shortened into a single check, and a return switch statement can be used.
- Style aside, the code is clear, coherent, effective and contains no noticeable bugs or errors.
